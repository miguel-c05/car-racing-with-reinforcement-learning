    "## Week 1: Customizing the environment\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment understanding\n",
    "First things first, we took the time to understand the underlying forces at play in this environment. The following are the collected insights:\n",
    "- **Action Space - Discrete vs Continuous**: This environment has, by default, a continuous action space (p.e.: steering $s \\in [-1, 1]$). However, it can be converted to a discrete action space (p.e. by only allowing full left or full right steering).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Friction**: As per the environment implementation, friction is a vector applied in the oposite direction of the moving car and proportional to its current speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Grip**: Describes the adherence of the car to the track. If the rear wheels angle to the cars current moving direction is too great, especially at high speeds, it will lose grip, and enter a **drifting motion**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, by reading the environment source code (available under [car_racing.py](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/main/gymnasium/envs/box2d/car_racing.py) and [car_dynamics.py](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium/blob/main/gymnasium/envs/box2d/car_dynamics.py)), we found that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The track itself is made out of tiles, which are squares with coordinates and rotation variables. They are held in a list in the `CarRacing` class, under `self.track`. Knowing this may make it possible to calculate the line with minimum curvature (ideal trajectory).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each wheel in `car.wheels` *knows* if it is over one or more road tiles. This is done by checking `len(wheel.tiles)`\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reward modifications\n",
    "We have noticed that the reward function (as described [here](https://gymnasium.farama.org/environments/box2d/car_racing/#rewards)) is very shallow, in the sense that it encourages process (by rewarding per tile completed) but does not encourage any type of behaviour to acheive that progress. As such, we plan to implement the following modifications:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Gas Bias**: Pushing forward must be encouraged. As such, and to counteract the early training association<br>\n",
    "`moving = crashing`, a small reward will be provided for pushing Gas.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Wiggle Protection**: Often a model trained on these sorts of environments will perform what is called **intentional wiggling**. That is when, in a curve, for example, the car switches sharply and repeatedly between right-steering and left-steering. This is a technique learnt by models to ensure car grip. It also is, however, a strategy that exploits simple environments, including `CarRacing-v3`, in which steering does not lose speed. To prevent this, sharply changing steering direction will have a moderate penalty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Off-road Penalty**: As described below under *Aditional modifications* the simulation will be truncated shortly after the car leaves the track, if it does not return quickly. However, giving a truncation a flat penalty does not seem appropriate, since it gives no context or warning\n",
    "\n",
    "### Aditional modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early stopping**: Prevents the simulation from going on when the car has deviated too far out of the track, leaving it aimlessly wandering around. Aims to quicken the training speed."
